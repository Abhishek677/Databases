            <p>A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually
                contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients 
                such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.
                In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called
                biscuits. Many Canadians also use this term. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies 
                even in the United Kingdom.[3] Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date
                squares or bars.
               Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, 
               Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another 
               sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes 
               "dunked", an approach which releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars,[4]
               while also softening their texture. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience
               stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, 
               with the latter ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations 
               such as Starbucks.</p>

               <p>Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some 
                   kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an 
                   array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried
                   fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.A general theory of cookies 
                   may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie
                   in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make 
                   the base (in the case of cakes called "batter"[9]) as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles – 
                   responsible for a cake's fluffiness – to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become
                   some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much 
                   more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake 
                   made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.</p>
               <p>Oils in baked cakes do not behave as baking soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than
                   evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases
                   from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the carbon dioxide 
                   released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive 
                   feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil)
                   that does not sink into it.</p>
